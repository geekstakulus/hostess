# Oberon Language Conformance Test Suite

This repository is a Git clone of the original Oberon Language Conformance Test Suite hosted on SourceForge.

## Description

The goal of this test suite is to provide a comprehensive set of conformance tests for Oberon language consumers, 
including compilers and language processors.
These tests cover various aspects of the Oberon language, 
such as syntax, 
type semantics, 
declarations, 
operators, 
statements, 
predefined functions, 
and essential 
components of the run-time system required by the language, 
including memory allocation.
Please note that this test suite focuses on the language itself and does not cover libraries

## Original Repository

You can find the original repository on SourceForge [here](http://hostess.sourceforge.net/). 
I have migrated it to Git and added it here make it more accessible to the developer community.

## Getting Started

To get started with these conformance tests, 
please refer to the examples.

and compiler implementers.

Happy coding!
